  abstract = {We conduct numerical experiments to determine whether interchange reconnection at high altitude coronal null points can explain the outflows observed as blueshifts in coronal emission lines at the boundaries between open and closed magnetic field regions. In this scenario, a strong, post-reconnection pressure gradient forms in the field-aligned direction when dense and hot, active region core loops reconnect with neighboring tenuous and cool, open field lines. We find that the pressure gradient drives a supersonic outflow and a rarefaction wave develops in both the open and closed post-reconnection magnetic field regions. We forward-model the spectral line profiles for a selection of coronal emission lines to predict the spectral signatures of the rarefaction wave. We find that the properties of the rarefaction wave are consistent with the observed velocity versus temperature structure of the corona in the outflow regions, where the velocity increases with the formation temperature of the emission lines. In particular, we find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed Fe XII 195.119 \AA{} spectral line profiles in terms of the blueshift (10 km s-1), full width at half-maximum (83 m\AA{}) and symmetry. Finally, we find that Ti $<$ Te in the open field region, which indicates that the interchange reconnection scenario may provide a viable mechanism and source region for the slow solar wind.},

  abstract = {Observing high-temperature, low emission measure plasma is key to unlocking the coronal heating problem. With current instrumentation, a combination of EUV spectral data from Hinode Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; sensitive to temperatures up to 4 MK) and broadband filter data from Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT; sensitive to higher temperatures) is typically used to diagnose the temperature structure of the observed plasma. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a "blind spot" exists in temperature-emission measure space for combined Hinode EIS and XRT observations. For a typical active region core with significant emission at 3-4 MK, Hinode EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with temperatures greater than \textasciitilde{}6 MK and emission measures less than
\textasciitilde{}1027 cm-5. We then demonstrate that the
temperature and emission measure limits of this blind spot depend upon the temperature distribution of the plasma along the line of sight by considering a hypothetical emission measure distribution sharply peaked at 1 MK. For this emission measure distribution, we find that EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with emission measures less than
\textasciitilde{}1026 cm-5. We suggest that a spatially and spectrally resolved 6-24 \AA{} spectrum would improve the sensitivity to these high-temperature, low emission measure plasma.},

  abstract = {We investigate several key questions of plasma heating in open-field regions of the corona that connect to the solar wind. We present results for a model of Alfv\'en-wave-driven turbulence for three typical open magnetic field structures: a polar coronal hole, an open flux tube neighboring an equatorial streamer, and an open flux tube near a strong-field active region. We compare time-steady, one-dimensional turbulent heating models against fully time-dependent three-dimensional reduced-magnetohydrodynamic modeling of BRAID. We find that the time-steady results agree well with time-averaged results from BRAID. The time dependence allows us to investigate the variability of the magnetic fluctuations and of the heating in the corona. The high-frequency tail of the power spectrum of fluctuations forms a power law whose exponent varies with height, and we discuss the possible physical explanation for this behavior. The variability in the heating rate is bursty and nanoflare-like in nature, and we analyze the amount of energy lost via dissipative heating in transient events throughout the simulation. The average energy in these events is 10 21.91 erg, within the ``picoflare'' range, and many events reach classical ``nanoflare'' energies. We also estimated the multithermal distribution of temperatures that would result from the heating-rate variability, and found good agreement with observed widths of coronal differential emission measure distributions. The results of the modeling presented in this paper provide compelling evidence that turbulent heating in the solar atmosphere by Alfv\'en waves accelerates the solar wind in open flux tubes.},

Estimates of temperature and density for the outflowing plasmas suggest a mass loss rate that amounts to $\sim$1/4 of the total mass loss rate of the solar wind.

The existing solar-wind models (e.g., the Wang\textendash{}Sheeley\textendash{}Arge model) provide the approximate locations of the solar wind sources based on magnetic field extrapolations. It has been suggested recently that plasma outflows observed at the edges of active regions may be a source of the slow solar wind. To explore this we analyze an isolated active region (AR) adjacent to small coronal hole (CH) in July/August 2009. On 1 August, Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer observations showed two compact outflow regions in the corona. Coronal rays were observed above the active-region coronal hole (ARCH) region on the eastern limb on 31 July by STEREO-A/EUVI and at the western limb on 7 August by CORONAS-Photon/TESIS telescopes. In both cases the coronal rays were co-aligned with open magnetic-field lines given by the potential field source surface model, which expanded into the streamer. The solar-wind parameters measured by STEREO-B, ACE, Wind, and STEREO-A confirmed the identification of the ARCH as a source region of the slow solar wind. The results of the study support the suggestion that coronal rays can represent signatures of outflows from ARs propagating in the inner corona along open field lines into the heliosphere.},

These solar wind sources were labeled active-region sources when the open flux was from a strong field region with no corresponding coronal hole in the NSO He 10830 \AA{} synoptic coronal-hole maps. Here, we present a detailed investigation of several of these active-region sources using ACE and Ulysses solar wind data, potential field models of the corona, and solar imaging data. We find that the solar wind from these active-region sources has distinct signatures, e.g., it generally has a higher oxygen charge state than wind associated with helium-10830 \AA{} coronal-hole sources, indicating a hotter source region, consistent with the active region source interpretation. We compare the magnetic topology of the open field lines of these active-region sources with images of the hot corona to search for corresponding features in EUV and soft X-ray images. In most, but not all, cases, a dark area is seen in the EUV and soft X-ray image as for familiar coronal-hole sources. However, in one case no dark area was evident in the soft X-ray images: the magnetic model showed a double dipole coronal structure consistent with the images, both indicating that the footpoints of the open field lines, rooted deep within the active region, lay near the separatrix between loops connecting to two different opposite polarity regions.},

The source of these periodic density structures is a significant and outstanding question. Are they generated in the interplanetary medium, or are they a relic of coronal activity as the solar wind was formed? We use AHe to answer this question, as solar wind elemental abundance ratios are not expected to change during transit. For this event, the anti-phase nature of the AHe variations strongly suggests that periodic solar wind density structures originate in the solar corona.},

  abstract = {The magnetic field in the heliosphere evolves in response to the photospheric field at its base. This evolution, together with the rotation of the Sun, drives space weather through the continually changing conditions of the solar wind and the magnetic field embedded within it. We combine observations and simulations to investigate the sources of the heliospheric field from 1996 to 2001. Our algorithms assimilate SOHO/MDI magnetograms into a flux-dispersal model, showing the evolving field on the full sphere with an unprecedented duration of 5.5 yr and temporal resolution of 6 hr. We demonstrate that acoustic far-side imaging can be successfully used to estimate the location and magnitude of large active regions well before they become visible on the solar disk. The results from our assimilation model, complemented with a potential-field source-surface model for the coronal and inner-heliospheric magnetic fields, match Yohkoh/SXT and KPNO/He 10830 \AA{} coronal hole boundaries quite well. Even subject to the simplification of a uniform, steady solar wind from the source surface outward, our model matches the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at Earth $\sim$3\% of the time during the period 1997\textendash{}2001 (independent of whether far-side acoustic data are incorporated into the simulation). We find that around cycle maximum, the IMF originates typically in a dozen disjoint regions. Whereas active regions are often ignored as a source for the IMF, the fraction of the IMF that connects to magnetic plage with absolute flux densities exceeding 50 Mx cm-2 increases from $\lessequivlnt$10\% at cycle minimum up to 30\textendash{}50\% at cycle maximum, with even direct connections between sunspots and the heliosphere. For the overall heliospheric field, these fractions are $\lessequivlnt$1\% to 20\textendash{}30\%, respectively. Two case studies based on high-resolution TRACE observations support the direct connection of the IMF to magnetic plage, and even to sunspots. Parallel to the data assimilation, we run a pure simulation in which active regions are injected based on random selection from parent distribution functions derived from solar data. The global properties inferred for the photospheric and heliospheric fields for these two models are in remarkable agreement, confirming earlier studies that no subtle flux-emergence patterns or field-dispersal properties are required of the solar dynamo beyond those that are included in the model in order to understand the large-scale solar and heliospheric fields.},

The scaling law is not an extension or a new variant of previous solar wind models, but rather a requirement on all solar wind models, which should apply quite generally to magnetically driven winds. Thus, this paper reveals an underlying connection between the solar wind and its coronal source.},

  abstract = {We propose a unified interpretation for persistent coronal outflows and metric radio noise storms, two phenomena typically observed in
association with quiescent solar active regions. Our interpretation is based on multi-wavelength observations of two such regions as they crossed the meridian in May and July 2007. For both regions, we observe a persistent pattern of blue-shifted coronal emission in
high-temperature lines with Hinode/EIS, and a radio noise storm with the Nan{\c c}ay Radioheliograph. The observations are supplemented by
potential and linear force-free extrapolations of the photospheric magnetic field over large computational boxes, and by a detailed analysis of the coronal magnetic field topology. We find true
separatrices in the coronal field and null points high in the corona, which are preferential locations for magnetic reconnection and electron acceleration. We suggest that the continuous growth of active regions maintains a steady reconnection across the separatrices at the null point. This interchange reconnection occurs between closed, high-density loops in the core of the active region and neighbouring open,
low-density flux tubes. Thus, the reconnection creates strong pressure imbalances which are the main drivers of plasma upflows. Furthermore, the acceleration of low-energy electrons in the interchange reconnection region sustains the radio noise storm in the closed loop areas, as well as weak type III emission along the open field lines. For both active regions studied, we find a remarkable agreement between the observed places of persistent coronal outflows and radio noise storms with their locations as predicted by our interpretation.},

  abstract = {Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) has discovered ubiquitous 
outflows of a few to 50 km s-1 from active regions (ARs).
These outflows are most prominent at the AR boundary and appear over
monopolar magnetic areas. They are linked to strong non-thermal line
broadening and are stronger in hotter EUV lines. The outflows persist
for at least several days. Using Hinode EIS and X-Ray Telescope
observations of AR 10942 coupled with magnetic modeling, we demonstrate
that the outflows originate from specific locations of the magnetic
topology where field lines display strong gradients of magnetic
connectivity, namely quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), or in the limit of
infinitely thin QSLs, separatrices. We found the strongest AR outflows
to be in the vicinity of QSL sections located over areas of strong
magnetic field. We argue that magnetic reconnection at QSLs separating
closed field lines of the AR and either large-scale externally connected
or "open" field lines is a viable mechanism for driving AR outflows
which are likely sources of the slow solar wind.},

This paper reviews our current understanding of these interrelated problems: coronal heating and the acceleration of the ambient solar wind. We also discuss where the community stands in its ability to forecast how variations in the solar wind (i.e., fast and slow wind streams) impact the Earth. Although the last few decades have seen significant progress in observations and modeling, we still do not have a complete understanding of the relevant physical processes, nor do we have a quantitatively precise census of which coronal structures contribute to specific types of solar wind. Fast streams are known to be connected to the central regions of large coronal holes. Slow streams, however, appear to come from a wide range of sources, including streamers, pseudostreamers, coronal loops, active regions, and coronal hole boundaries. Complicating our understanding even more is the fact that processes such as turbulence, stream-stream interactions, and Coulomb collisions can make it difficult to unambiguously map a parcel measured at 1 AU back down to its coronal source. We also review recent progress\textemdash{}in theoretical modeling, observational data analysis, and forecasting techniques that sit at the interface between data and theory\textemdash{}that gives us hope that the above problems are indeed solvable.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that active-region (AR) upflowing plasma, observed 
by the EUV-Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode, can gain access to
open-field lines and be released into the solar wind (SW) via
magnetic-interchange reconnection at magnetic null-points in
pseudo-streamer configurations. When only one bipolar AR is present on
the Sun and is fully covered by the separatrix of a streamer, such as AR
10978 in December 2007, it seems unlikely that the upflowing AR plasma
can find its way into the slow SW. However, signatures of plasma with AR
composition have been found at 1 AU by Culhane et al. ( Solar Phys. 289,
3799, 2014) that apparently originated west of AR 10978. We present a
detailed topology analysis of AR 10978 and the surrounding large-scale
corona based on a potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model. Our study
shows that it is possible for the AR plasma to move around the streamer
separatrix and be released into the SW via magnetic reconnection, which
occurs in at least two main steps. We analyse data from the
Nan{\c c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) in a search for evidence of the
chain of magnetic reconnections that we propose. We find a noise storm
above the AR and several varying sources at 150.9 MHz. Their locations
suggest that they might be associated with particles accelerated during
the first-step reconnection process at a null point well outside of the
AR. We find no evidence of the second reconnection step in the radio
data, however. Our results demonstrate that even when it appears highly
improbable for the AR plasma to reach the SW, indirect channels
involving a sequence of reconnections can make it possible.},

  abstract = {Seeking to establish whether active region upflow material contributes 
to the slow solar wind, we examine in detail the plasma upflows from
Active Region (AR)10978, which crossed the Sun's disc in the interval 8
to 16 December, 2007 during Carrington rotation (CR)2064. In previous
work, using data from the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, upflow
velocity evolution was extensively studied as the region crossed the
disc while a linear force-free magnetic extrapolation was used to
confirm aspects of the velocity evolution and to establish the presence
of quasi-separatrix layers at the upflow source areas. The plasma
properties, temperature, density and first ionisation potential bias
(FIP-bias) were measured with the spectrometer during the disc passage
of the active region. Global potential field source surface (PFSS)
models showed that AR 10978 was completely covered by the closed field
of a helmet streamer that is part of the streamer belt. Thus it is not
clear how any of the upflowing AR-associated plasma could reach the
source surface at 2.5 R(Sun)and contribute to the slow solar wind.
However a detailed examination of solar-wind in-situ data obtained by
the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft at the L1 point shows
that the increase in O\^7+/O\^6+, C\^6+/C\^5+ and Fe/O - a FIP-bias proxy -
are present before the heliospheric current sheet crossing. These
increases, along with an accompanying reduction in proton velocity and
an increase in density are characteristic of both AR and slow-wind
plasma. Finally we describe a two-step reconnection process by which
some of the upflowing plasma from the AR could reach the heliosphere.},

data) have been analyzed with the Doppler dimming technique to provide
for the first time daily 2D images of the radial wind speed between 1
and 6 R $\odot$ over 1 month of observations. Results show that
both polar and equatorial regions are characterized at the base of the
corona by plasma outflows at speeds $>$ 100 km s-1. The
plasma is then decelerated within \texttildelow{}1.5 R $\odot$ at the
poles and \texttildelow{}2.0 R $\odot$ at the equator, where local
minima of the expansion speeds are reached, and gently reaccelerated
higher up, reaching speeds typical of fast and slow wind components. The
mass flux is highly variable with latitude and time at the equator and
more uniform and stable over the poles. The polar flow is asymmetric,
with speeds above the south pole lower than those above the north pole.
A correlation (anticorrelation) between the wind speed and its density
is found below (above) \texttildelow{}1.8 R $\odot$. The 2D
distribution of forces responsible for deceleration and reacceleration
of solar wind is provided and interpreted in terms of Alfv\'en

Carrington Rotation (CR 2053) by analyzing the solar data through
spectroscopic observations of the plasma upflow regions and the in situ
data of the wind itself. Following earlier authors, we link solar and in
situ observations by a combination of ballistic backmapping and
potential-field source-surface modeling. We find three sources of fast
solar wind that are low-latitude coronal holes. The coronal holes do not
produce a steady fast wind, but rather a wind with rapid fluctuations.
The coronal spectroscopic data from Hinode's Extreme Ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer show a mixture of upflow and downflow regions
highlighting the complexity of the coronal hole, with the upflows being
dominant. There is a mix of open and multi-scale closed magnetic fields
in this region whose (interchange) reconnections are consistent with the
up- and downflows they generate being viewed through an optically thin
corona, and with the strahl directions and freeze-in temperatures found
in in situ data. At the boundary of slow and fast wind streams there are
three short periods of enhanced-velocity solar wind, which we term
intermediate based on their in situ characteristics. These are related
to active regions that are located beside coronal holes. The active
regions have different magnetic configurations, from bipolar through
tripolar to quadrupolar, and we discuss the mechanisms to produce this
intermediate wind, and the important role that the open field of coronal
holes adjacent to closed-field active regions plays in the process.},

  abstract = {One of the most interesting discoveries from Hinode is the presence of 
persistent high-temperature high-speed outflows from the edges of active
regions (ARs). EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS) measurements indicate that
the outflows reach velocities of 50 km s-1 with spectral line
asymmetries approaching 200 km s-1. It has been suggested
that these outflows may lie on open field lines that connect to the
heliosphere, and that they could potentially be a significant source of
the slow speed solar wind. A direct link has been difficult to
establish, however. We use EIS measurements of spectral line intensities
that are sensitive to changes in the relative abundance of Si and S as a
result of the first ionization potential (FIP) effect, to measure the
chemical composition in the outflow regions of AR 10978 over a 5 day
period in 2007 December. We find that Si is always enhanced over S by a
factor of 3-4. This is generally consistent with the enhancement factor
of low FIP elements measured in situ in the slow solar wind by
non-spectroscopic methods. Plasma with a slow wind-like composition was
therefore flowing from the edge of the AR for at least 5 days.
Furthermore, on December 10 and 11, when the outflow from the western
side was favorably oriented in the Earth direction, the Si/S ratio was
found to match the value measured a few days later by the Advanced
Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer. These
results provide strong observational evidence for a direct connection
between the solar wind, and the coronal plasma in the outflow regions.},
