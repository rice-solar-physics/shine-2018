Below are the fundamental questions that we will attempt to address in this session,

1. How are active region loops topologically connected/related to solar wind streamers?
2. What role does reconnection play in transporting plasma from closed coronal loops into the solar wind?
3. What are the primary observable signatures of impulsive heating in active regions? in the solar wind? Are these signatures correlated?
4. Do signatures of the heating in ARs persist in the slow solar wind? Are they observable?
5. How can future instruments (e.g. Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, especially SPICE) be used to identify such signatures?
6. What kinds of models are needed to understand the relationship between closed-field ARs and the slow wind?
