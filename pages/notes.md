Below are some rough notes from the discussion that followed this session at SHINE 2018. For more specific information, see the [slides](slides) from both invited and contributed talks.

## Scene-setting Talk 1

* lots of structure when you zoom into ARs
* primary tools for loop studies---EUV and X-Ray
* nanoflares---impulsive heating, agnostic to underlying cause
* short-lived brightenings in moss, blue shifts signature of nanoflares
* nanoflares popular, but mechanism highly-debated
* persistent blue shifts from active regions; occur where intensity (density) is lowest
* outflows due to interchange reconnection between closed loops and open fieldlines
* enhenaced low FIP elements in AR outflows
* two-step reconnection process
* non-Maxwellian diagnostics

## Scene-setting Talk 2

* sources?
    * open field
    * dipolar streamers
    * pseudostreamers
    * transients
* Heavy ions
    * ion composition determined within 4 to 5 solar radii
    * determined by loop properties and release mechansims; no evolution during propagation
    * elemental abundances determined within 1 to 2 solar radii
    * Test particles in the flow, do not control the flow
* Fastest wind has lowest charge state
* Slow wind broader range of Fe to O, but higher charge state
* Open magnetic fields linking back down to ARs---how?
* High time resolution measurements may help to disentangle sources of multi-temperature plasma
* Ionization state may be a useful marker for mapping between wind and locations on the Sun
    * How does photoionization affect this?
* From remote sensing enhancements, can we correlate with enhancements in in-situ data?
    * Time-dependence important, but hard to resolve with current instrumentation

## Additional Questions

* Can we use loop models to simulate these processes?
    * How can we connect them to wind models?
    * How to produce wind observables?
* What constraints can IRIS/EIS provide? [follow-up from Vanessa's talk]
* Deviations from Maxwellians? Are there correlated between ARs and wind?
    * But a lot happens (kinetic-wise) between the Sun and 1 AU... [Lepri and Viall]
* How consistent are periodicities in the wind?
* Correlations between outflows and type III radio bursts? Need statistics... [Bin Chen]
